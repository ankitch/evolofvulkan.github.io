              Vulkan is a new low-level API for 3D graphics and GPU-based computations, which was brought to us by Khronos Group. Its low-level abstraction allows a developer to work more closely to the hardware giving wider control on handling hardware, and hence achieving the increased performance of a graphics application if programmed well.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-content">
              Vulkan is designed to reduce CPU overhead and latency, reaching new level of performance. Simply speaking, it is able to avoid CPU bottlenecks because of its low CPU usage and its ability to distribute work efficiently among multiple CPU cores. Because of this, Vulkan is able to draw out the maximum potential of GPU.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-content">
              Vukan is often seen as a competitor to Microsoft's new DirectX 12. Although they both have a different approach internally as APIs, they are both targeted towards the sumilar goal&mdash;massive framerate increase in games, drastic decrease in CPU workload (low CPU overhead), and better use of CPU's multiple cores.

              AMD's Mantle has been used as a foundation for Vulkan API. Mantle is also a low-level API targeted at 3D graphics espically video games. The goals of AMD for Mantle were to achieve higher framerates, reduced rendering latency, reduced GPU power consumption, and better handling of multi-core CPUs. However, with its idea of proprietary trademark and support for only AMD graphic cards, the game support list was pretty small, and it was bound to fall.
          </p>
          <p class="intro-content">
              That's where Vulkan API came into the scene. Before Mantle fell completely, it was miraculuously resurrected as a Vulkan. Vulkan has assimilated the 'best and brightest' parts of Mantle while still being a non-proprietary tool supporting many Operating Systems, and both Nvidia and AMD graphic cards.

            OpenGL is also a graphics redering API initially developed by Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) and now managed by Khronos Group. OpenGL has been constantly evolving for over two decades and has numerous improvements in that time. However, only doings patchups and improvements on same base will not always be enough. Sometimes, a full rework has to be done to beget something more game changing.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-content">
            Yes, that's how Vulkan API came into being, and seen as a successor to OpenGL. Also, it was initially referred to as "next generation OpenGL initiative".

          <p class="intro-content">
            Currently, Vulkan is being used in gaming industry. Games like <em>The Talos Principle</em>, <em>W.N.C: Infantry</em>, and <em>Ashes Of The Singularity</em> are on the Vulkan support line for now. Although the game support list is pretty small right now, many professionals foresee the high potential graphics API being used more extensively across many games over different platforms in near future.
