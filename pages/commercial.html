                <p class="intro-content">Samsung had launched its latest smart phone Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge. In the graphics industry the goal of vulkan is to make it easier to get better graphics performance by fully utilizing your multi-core processor. Samsung is going to use Vulkan to court developers to create experiences that compete directly with Apple's claim that gaming is better on the iPhone. By offering this before anyone else, Samsung is able to approach developers in the open at events like the company's upcoming developer conference and get great games that play best on the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. The other big reason Samsung is jumping on the opportunity to be the first manufacturer with Vulkan support is the Gear VR. Samsung and Oculus have done a great job elevating smartphone-based VR above the passive Google Cardboard experience, but the platform is not without performance issues. With Oculus and Samsung both acting as members of the Khronos Group, it makes sense that both companies would be encouraging developers to support this new technology in order to continue improving the Gear VR experience. There's no doubt this will be the exact opposite of an overnight performance increase, but the potential for Vulkan to open doors to better experiences couldn't be more clear. With the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge, it's a first step for Samsung towards a powerful new gaming and VR experience and a good time to stand head and shoulders above the competition and claim they were here first.</p>
